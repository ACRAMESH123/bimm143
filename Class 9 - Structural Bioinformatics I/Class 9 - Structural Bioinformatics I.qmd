The main database for structural data is called the PDB (Protein Data Bank). Lets see what it contains.


I need to remove the comma and convert to numeric to do math:
```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv")
as.numeric(sub(",", "", stats$Total))
stats


```

I could turn this into a function to fix the whole table or any future table I read like this:
```{r}
comma2numeric <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(sub(",", "", x))
}
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, comma2numeric)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbdb <- read_csv("pdb_stats.csv")
```


```{r}
sum(pdbdb$Total)
```

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$`X-ray`)/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
sum(pdbdb$EM)/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100

```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
84.5% for X-ray and 8.7% for electron microscopy.

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$Total)
pdbdb$Total[1]/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
86.65%%
